                <p>
                      Interface Computer College then known as Interface Computer Learning Center was established in 1982 at the 2nd floor of Cartimar building along Claro M. Recto Avenue in Quiapo Manila. It then became a college in 1994 when IT-related programs were added to its already existing wide-range portfolio of short-term courses. Proud to say that all the programs and courses offered are duly recognized and authorized by Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and Technical Skills and Development Authority (TESDA) and accredited by Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) , Civil Service Commission (CSC), and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).
